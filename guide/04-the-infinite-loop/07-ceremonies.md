# L∞P ceremonies

In this section, we are going to take a look at the L∞P Ceremonies. We will mention common Ceremonies from other methodologies, clarify why we will not use them, and introduce some new ones.

- ❌ We don't use Sprints because A sprint is a time box, and we believe that time boxes lead to decreased quality and lower customer value, so we don't have any Sprint-based meetings. Including ❌ Sprint planning, ❌ Sprint review and ❌ Sprint retrospective. However, we value the principles behind the Sprint retrospective. We host a monthly ✅ **Operations review meeting** to reinforce a continuous improvement culture. This meeting also replaces the Service Delivery Review meeting from Kanban.

- ❌ We don't host the Delivery planning and Risk review meetings from Kanban because they strongly focus on outputs.

- ✅ We host as many **User research/testing sessions** as needed to validate hypotheses and generate product ideas. The entire team participates in the research phase, sales and development included.

- ✅ We block 4 hours daily in people's calendars to ensure they can get into the zone and move fast. We call this the **Do Not Disturb (DnD) meeting**.

- ✅ We host a **daily stand-up meeting**, but we use meeting agendas to ensure they don't become a checkpoint. The goal is to provide the team with clear goals and autonomy for the rest of the day.

- ✅ Every Monday, we host a **Replenishment meeting** to evaluate if we should bring more tasks from the discovery and development backlogs into the board.

- ✅ We host a monthly **Show and Tell meeting** to enable conversation across teams, share research insights, and celebrate our achievements.

- ✅ We host monthly **hackathons** to encourage the development team to generate product ideas and reinforce the involvement of the developers in the discovery phase.

- ✅ We host quarterly **Strategy review meeting** to align the product teams with the leadership's mission, vision and strategy.
