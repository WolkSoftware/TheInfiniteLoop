# What is the purpose of the infinite loop?

> "Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things"
> 
> â€” Peter Drucker.

The software industry is notoriously inefficient and ineffective. The Infinite Loop aims to help organisations and individuals become more effective and efficient in their work and increase the success rate of software projects.

Our strategy is to attempt to resolve or at least improve the mainstream failures and widespread estate of despair in the software industry.

## Mainstream failure

The Standish Group's CHAOS Report is probably the most extensive and longest-running research study in the software industry. The CHAOS Report examined thousands of software projects over three decades and found some very disappointing performance metrics:

- Over the last three decades, the success rate of software projects has never exceeded 38%. 

- The success rate of software projects increased between 1994 and 2015 but has decreased since then.

The success rate of software projects is affected by a multitude of factors, so it is difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the trend of increasing success rate from 1994 to 2015 followed by a decline since then. However, here are a few possible explanations for this trend:

- Improvement in project management practices: Agile methodologies, which prioritize collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development, gained popularity in the early 2000s and were widely adopted in software development. This approach may have contributed to higher success rates by improving communication and adaptability.

- Emergence of new technologies and platforms: During the 1990s and 2000s, the software industry experienced a rapid expansion of new technologies and platforms, such as web applications, mobile apps, and cloud computing. These new technologies and platforms may have contributed to higher success rates by increasing the capabilities and flexibility of software development.

- Growing complexity of software projects: As software systems became more complex and interconnected, the difficulty of managing software projects increased. This complexity could have contributed to the recent decline in success rates, as projects may face more technical and organizational challenges.

- Changing expectations and demands: As technology continues to evolve, users and businesses have become more sophisticated in their expectations and demands for software products. This may have contributed to the recent decline in success rates, as projects may struggle to meet increasingly high standards.

- Lack of skilled professionals: There is a global shortage of skilled software developers, which can lead to project delays, quality issues, and other problems. This shortage may have contributed to the recent decline in success rates, as companies struggle to find and retain talented developers.

We are going to choose to ignore "Lack of skilled professionals" because according to Brooks' law that could even be a good thing. We believe that the main reason for the decline in success rates is the "Growing complexity of software projects" and we will include the "Changing expectations and demands" into this complexity increase.

**Brooks' law** is an observation about software project management according to which adding manpower to a software project that is behind schedule delays it even longer. It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month.

The "Emergence of new technologies and platforms" such as cloud computing are a blessing because thy have removed a lot of the complexity from software development but they have also added a lot of complexity. The conclusion for us us that the "Improvement in project management practices" did play a role in the increase in success rates but as the complexity of software projects increased the "Improvement in project management practices" could not keep up with the complexity.

The problems go beyond project failures. Other reports put the spotlight on other equally depressing facts: 

- In 2018, Stripe estimated that there is ~$300 billion of Global GDP loss annually due to developer inefficiency.

## Widespread estate of despair

At Wolk Software we interact with many developers and technology businesses daily, and sadly, we believe the CHAOS and the Stripe reports are accurate. What I have witnessed across our industry is mostly a widespread estate of despair. The following list contains some of the most common problems:

### As a developer
- Feeling unproductive
- Low work-life-balance
- Low autonomy
- Failing to see the impact of work
- Meaningless meetings
- Mundane, repetitive tasks
- Unrealistic arbitrary deadlines
- Constant interruptions
- Dealing with site reliability issues
- Working around technical debt
- Changing priorities
- Context switching
- Cognitive overload
- Slow feedback loops
- Lost trust in management
- Lost trust in other departments
- Burnout

### As a business
- Unable to compete
- Struggling to retain customers
- Struggling to gain new customers
- Increasing customer acquisition costs
- Struggling to attract talent
- Struggling to retain talent
- Lacking innovation
- Lacking agility
- Low employee morale
- Business divisions are hostile towards each other
- Lost trust in development

## The purpose of The Infinite Loop

Employee satisfaction and engagement are at an all-time low in the software industry (and across the entire global economy). Job satisfaction and engagement can positively impact an employee's well-being. Employees who are satisfied with their jobs and engaged in their work are more likely to experience a sense of fulfilment and accomplishment, leading to increased motivation and higher productivity levels. Being productive is not just good for business; it can positively impact our well-being in several ways.

- Sense of accomplishment and purpose. When we accomplish tasks and progress towards our goals, it can give us a sense of accomplishment and purpose, boosting our self-esteem and self-confidence, which are essential components of overall well-being.

- Reduce stress and anxiety. Completing tasks or progressing towards our goals can help alleviate feeling overwhelmed or overloaded, which are common sources of stress. In turn, reducing stress can lead to better mental and physical health.

- Maintain a positive outlook and sense of control. We are less likely to feel helpless or out of control when actively working towards our goals. This sense of control can lead to greater resilience in facing challenges and setbacks.

At Wolk Software, we know what it is like to be part of a high-performing team, and we have experienced the professional fulfilment that comes with it and the derived mental health benefits. Being a player in the winning team can be an invigorating experience, and we want to help more software professionals experience it.

Creating high-performance teams and increasing the success rate of software projects is very good for business, but it is not our purpose; it is just our strategy. Our purpose is to improve the life of software professionals by helping them to work in an environment that makes them feel trusted, empowered, engaged and valued. An environment that empowers them to become the best version of themselves.
