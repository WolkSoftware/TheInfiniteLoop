The problem is that technical debt is not a disease but a symptom. Several factors cause technical debt, but the most significant is time pressure. Time pressure itself is often the result of unhappy customers. Sometimes fixing technical debt is a waste of time because as long as we don\'t cure the disease, we will continue to create unsustainable levels of technical debt. What is the disease? In most cases, the disease is a leadership/culture that focuses on outputs over outcomes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"fundamentals/cultural-issues/lack-of-trust":{"id":"fundamentals/cultural-issues/lack-of-trust","title":"Lack of trust","description":"\\"Build projects around motivated individuals.
