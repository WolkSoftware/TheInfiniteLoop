# LâˆžP's ceremonies

In this section, we are going to take a look at the LâˆžP Ceremonies. We will mention common Ceremonies from other methodologies, clarify why we will not use them, and introduce some new ones.

## ðŸ”´ Sprints
We don't use Sprints because A sprint is a time box, and we believe that time boxes lead to decreased quality and lower customer value, so we don't have any Sprint-based meetings. Including ðŸ”´ Sprint planning, ðŸ”´ Sprint review and ðŸ”´ Sprint retrospective. However, we value the principles behind the Sprint retrospective. 
  
## ðŸ”´ Operations & Service delivery reviews
We don't host Operations review or Service delivery review meeting from kanban either. We trust that the team has the best judgement to decide what to do and when to allocate capacity to tasks that will improve the team's efficiency.

## ðŸ”´ Delivery planning and Risk review
We don't host the Delivery planning and Risk review meetings from Kanban because they strongly focus on outputs.

## ðŸ”´ Replenishment meeting
We don't host the Replenishment meeting from kanban. While this meeting was never intended to represent a deadline, we believe bad management will see it as an opportunity to corrupt it into one. Therefore, we believe it is better not to host it. Bringing new work items to the board should happen continuously and organically; ad-hoc meetings should be enough to handle this. We trust that the team will seek additional work every time capacity arrives.

## ðŸŸ¢ User research/testing sessions
We host as many ad-hoc User research/testing sessions as needed to validate hypotheses and generate product ideas. The entire team participates in the research phase, sales and development included.

## ðŸŸ¢ Do Not Disturb (DnD)
We block 4 hours daily in people's calendars to ensure they can get into the zone and move fast. We call this the Do Not Disturb "meeting".

## ðŸŸ¢ Daily stand-ups
We host daily stand-up, but we use meeting agendas to ensure they don't become a checkpoint. The meeting should be timed to 10 minutes and the goal is to provide the team with clear goals and autonomy for the rest of the day.

## ðŸŸ¢ Show and tell meeting
We host a monthly Show and tell meeting to enable conversation across teams, share research insights, and celebrate our achievements.

## ðŸŸ¡ Hackathons
We recommend hosting monthly hackathons to encourage the development team to generate product ideas and reinforce the involvement of the developers in the discovery phase.

## ðŸŸ¡ Strategy review meeting
We recommend hosting quarterly Strategy review meeting to align the product teams with the leadership's mission, vision and strategy.
