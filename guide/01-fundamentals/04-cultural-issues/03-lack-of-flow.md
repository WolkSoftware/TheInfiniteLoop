# Lack of flow

A weak mission and vision and a lack of trust directly impact individual performance because they prevent individuals from entering a flow state. A flow state, also known as being in the zone, is a highly productive state of mind where a person loses track of time and is entirely focused on their work. 

A flow state is considered ideal for achieving maximum productivity and is often sought after by individuals and organisations. However, the average person experiences a flow state only rarely because their work environment and culture can often prevent it from happening.

To achieve a flow state, there are certain prerequisites that must be met:

- A strong sense of purpose and autonomy (powered by a culture of trust and ownership)
- Clear goals
- A minimal amount of unknowns 
- Low levels of context switching and cognitive overload
- A minimum of 3-4 hours of quiet time each day 

Having a team that regularly experiences flow state can greatly impact an organisation's success. Such a team is estimated to be 10 times more productive than an average team, making it a formidable weapon against the competition. Organisations need to create a work environment and culture that supports a flow state and maximises the potential of their employees.
