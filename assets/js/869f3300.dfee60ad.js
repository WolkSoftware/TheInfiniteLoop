Being a pragmatic programmer means approaching software development practically and sensibly based on the specific context of the project and the needs of users and stakeholders. They can make trade-offs and compromises, balancing the competing demands of time, budget, and available resources, and make decisions based on what is feasible and achievable in the given context. A pragmatic programmer focuses on delivering working software that meets the project's requirements rather than adhering rigidly to theoretical principles or dogmatic rules, pursuing perfection or theoretical purity. A lack of pragmatism can lead to premature optimisations, feature overload, over-engineering a product, being difficult to maintain, and ultimately failing to deliver value to users and stakeholders."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
