Developing a successful digital product is considered an infinite game because it is never truly \\"won.\\" The goal of an infinite game is to keep the game going, with no clear endpoint and dynamic rules. This is in contrast to finite games, where the objective is to win and there is a clear endpoint with set rules.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cultural-issues/lack-of-flow":{"id":"cultural-issues/lack-of-flow","title":"Lack of flow","description":"One of the goals of L\u221eP is to encourage the creation of work environments that facilitate a flow state. A flow state, also known as being in the zone, is a highly productive state of mind where a person loses track of time and is entirely focused on their work. This state is considered ideal for achieving maximum productivity and is often sought after by individuals and organisations. However, the average person experiences a flow state only rarely because their work environment and culture can often prevent it from happening.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cultural-issues/lack-of-pragmatism":{"id":"cultural-issues/lack-of-pragmatism","title":"Lack of pragmatisim","description":"\ud83d\udea7 Sorry, this section is coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cultural-issues/lack-of-trust":{"id":"cultural-issues/lack-of-trust","title":"Lack of trust","description":"\ud83d\udea7 Sorry, this section is coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"fundamentals/what-is-the-infinite-loop":{"id":"fundamentals/what-is-the-infinite-loop","title":"What is The Infinite Loop?","description":"The Infinite Loop is an Agile software development methodology designed to help technology businesses create a culture of trust, ownership, and data-driven continuous experimentation that fosters sustainable product-led growth and high-performance digital product teams.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"fundamentals/what-is-the-philosophy-of-the-infinite-loop":{"id":"fundamentals/what-is-the-philosophy-of-the-infinite-loop","title":"What is the philosophy The Infinite Loop?","description":"In this section, we will share what we believe are the root causes of the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the software industry and the principles we believe should guide us while attempting to solve these problems.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"fundamentals/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-infinite-loop":{"id":"fundamentals/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-infinite-loop","title":"What is the purpose of the infinite loop?","description":"\\"Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things\\"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"operational-issues/extreme-programming":{"id":"operational-issues/extreme-programming","title":"Extreme programming (1998)","description":"\ud83d\udea7 Sorry, this section is coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"operational-issues/FAST-agile":{"id":"operational-issues/FAST-agile","title":"FAST Agile (2022)","description":"\ud83d\udea7 Sorry, this section is coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"operational-issues/kanban":{"id":"operational-issues/kanban","title":"Kanban (2010)","description":"Kanban was introduced as an alternative or complement to Scrum, which was already widely used in the industry.
