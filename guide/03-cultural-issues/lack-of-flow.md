# Lack of flow

One of the goals of LâˆžP is to encourage the creation of work environments that facilitate a flow state. A flow state, also known as being in the zone, is a highly productive state of mind where a person loses track of time and is entirely focused on their work. This state is considered ideal for achieving maximum productivity and is often sought after by individuals and organisations. However, the average person experiences a flow state only rarely because their work environment and culture can often prevent it from happening.

To achieve a flow state, there are certain prerequisites that must be met:

- A strong sense of purpose and autonomy (powered by a culture of trust and ownership)
- Clear goals
- A minimal amount of unknowns 
- Low levels of context switching and cognitive overload
- A minimum of 3-4 hours of quiet time each day 

Having a team that regularly experiences flow state can greatly impact an organisation's success. Such a team is estimated to be 10 times more productive than an average team, making it a formidable weapon against the competition. Organisations need to create a work environment and culture that supports a flow state and maximises the potential of their employees.
