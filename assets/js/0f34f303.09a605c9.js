Despite knowing that estimates in software are inaccurate by nature, Scrum teams often try to fill the story point capacity of each team member during the Sprint, leaving no room for mistakes. When estimation errors inevitably occur, the team has to compensate by changing the scope, increasing capacity, or changing the deadline. Brooks's law tells us that increasing capacity often leads to more issues, and management often rejects changing the deadline or the scope. Often the only option becomes to take shortcuts and introduce unsustainable levels of technical debt. In future sprints, the technical debt caused further estimation mistakes, introducing even more technical debt. Pressure and frustration ramp up; some employees experience stress, anxiety and even burnout.
