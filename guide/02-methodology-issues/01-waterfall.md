# Waterfall (1956-1995?)

The Waterfall is an SDM that uses a linear approach in which each phase must be completed before the next one can begin. The name "waterfall" comes from the idea of representing each stage as a "water dam". As we progress, the dam is filling. Only when the stage is complete can the water overflow and starts to fall into a "lower dam", representing the progress in the next stage.

Developing software without any plan is almost certainly a recipe for chaos. The waterfall SDM was one of the earliest attempts to prevent projects from falling into the abyss in which chaos resides.

The good thing about Waterfall is undoubtedly better than chaos. The bad things are that it has a very rigid structure. It does a poor job managing uncertainty and leads to low customer and stakeholder engagement, infrequent & deferred testing, and scope creep.

Like in finance, in software, "Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing". We create SDMs in the first place to "mitigate risks" or, in other words, "eliminate unknowns". Since Waterfall does a poor job managing uncertainty, it is no surprise that Waterfall is today recognised as a recipe for failure in software projects.
