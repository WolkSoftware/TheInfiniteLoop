# Scrum (1995)

Scrum is an Agile SDM that presents organisations with a prescript process. The organisation that governs Scrum did an excellent job documenting the process and facilitating its mainstream adoption through certification programmes. 

Scrum quickly became the most adopted Agile SDM. Process changes in larger organisations are usually riskier, but Scrum provided executives with enough resources to mitigate some of their fears. Some of the leading businesses in the software industry adopted Scrum, and their influence quickly pushed smaller players to follow.

Scrum can be summarised as follows: 

- Scrum proposes dividing the delivery of software projects into smaller iterations known as Sprints. 

- The sprints are usually 2 to 4 weeks long. There is a repository of work items known as the Product backlog. 

- The backlog is prioritised by a team member known as the Product owner. 

- The product owner is a team member who profoundly understands the business and the product.

- At the beginning of the Sprint, there is a Sprint planning session to determine the Sprint's goal and scope. The work items that become part of the Sprint are moved from the Product Backlog into the Sprint backlog.  

- Every day, there is a meeting known as the Daily Standup in which the team members ensure that work can continue during the Sprint as planned. Resolving any impediments is prioritised during the Daily Standup.

- At the end of the Sprint, the completed work (known as product increment) is released, and there is a meeting known as the Sprint retrospective that aims to identify ways to improve how the team operates over time.

The best thing about Scrum is that it facilitated the mainstream adoption of agile and managed to "kill" Waterfall. Scrum helped businesses embrace the idea of planning being something that adheres to the "law of diminishing returns". At first, planning seems to improve things, but there is a point at which investing more in planning fails to provide any meaningful returns.

Some of the worst things about Scrum include the following:

- Whether we like it or not, the reality of building software products is that there will always be a high level of unknowns that cannot be resolved by planning or estimating. The only way to resolve these unknowns is through discovery or experimentation (e.g. development of a prototype). While Scrum is highly prescript, it fails to establish a formal "discovery" phase. Scrum also failed to encourage user-centric design explicitly. 

- Some of Scrum's metrics, such as burn-down charts and rules (such as the time-boxed nature of the Sprints), encourage organisations to emphasise outputs over outcomes subconsciously, leading to decreased quality.

- The combination of Scrum's emphasis time-boxes (Sprints) and estimates and the historical background that preceded it (Waterfall) made Scrum too easy to bastardise into mini-waterfall iterations by the executive teams in many organisations.
