# LâˆžP's team & roles

> "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together"
> 
> â€” African proverb

LâˆžP tries to balance collaboration and working as a team, so we can attempt to achieve goals that are bigger than ourselves (go far) with focus and alone time so we can get into the zone and be super productive (go fast). When we work together, our goal should be to remove unknowns and enable autonomy; then, we can go our separate ways and get stuff done.

The LâˆžP team structure is designed to ensure all disciplines are aligned and work without silos. Instead of having separate teams for product development, sales, marketing, and other functions, there is one cross-functional team in charge of discovery and development. This team integrates with sales and marketing by aligning goals and strategies around the product.

## ðŸ”´ Scrum master

## ðŸŸ¢ The Product Manager
The Product Manager is a key role in this structure, taking on both the roles of product owner and scrum master. The Product Manager is responsible for leading the team and making decisions that impact the product, as well as ensuring that the product is delivered on time and within budget.

## ðŸŸ¢ Sales
A sales representative is another important role in the team, responsible for identifying and closing deals with potential customers. The Sales team works closely with the Product Manager to understand the customer needs and ensure that the product meets those needs.

## ðŸŸ¢ UX
UX designers play a crucial role in the product-led growth organisation, responsible for the design and usability of the product. The UX team works closely with the Product Manager and Engineering to ensure that the product is easy to use and meets the customer's needs.

## ðŸŸ¢ Architecture and Engineering
Architecture and Engineering work together to build and maintain the product, ensuring that it meets the technical requirements. The Architecture team is responsible for creating the blueprint for the product, while the Engineering team implements the design.

## ðŸŸ¢ Marketing
A marketing representative is responsible for promoting the product to the customer, and is an integral part of the cross-functional team. The Marketing team works closely with the Product Manager and Sales to create a marketing strategy that aligns with the product goals and supports the product-led growth strategy.
