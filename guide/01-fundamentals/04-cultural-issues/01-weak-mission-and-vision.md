# Weak mission and vision

> "Rules and regulations, laws and contracts, can never replace clarity of shared purpose and clear, deeply held principles about conduct in pursuit of that purpose."

True leaders should lead with context, not control. Providing context starts with sharing a strong mission and vision:

A weak mission and vision may result in a lack of clarity and direction for employees. Without a clear sense of purpose and direction, employees may struggle to understand how their work contributes to the organization's overall goals. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion, frustration, and a sense of disconnection from the organization's mission, ultimately resulting in a lack of engagement.

A weak mission and vision may limit the autonomy of employees. When there is no clear sense of direction, managers may be more likely to micromanage employees, providing detailed instructions for every task and decision. This lack of autonomy can lead to a lack of agility, as the organization may struggle to adapt to new challenges and opportunities. Micromanagement can stifle creativity and innovation, as employees may feel they have little room to experiment and take risks.
