# L∞P principles

L∞P proposed ten equally essential principles:

- **Customer-Centric**: Everyone should be in constant direct contact with customers, understand their needs, and be obsessed with delivering value to them.

- **Value-Driven**: The team is asked to deliver an outcome, not an output. The effectiveness and efficiency of the team is measured by the success of the customers, not by outputs (No Burn-down charts).

- **Product-Led**: Remove silos between marketing, sales, customer success, and the product team.

- **Trust & Ownership**: The product team is tasked with leading the customer to success and having total freedom to come up with the optimal solution.

- **Flow-Friendly**: There must be at least 50% allocated focus time on the calendar every day.

- **No Estimates & No time boxes**: Use a pull-based system. Focus on one work item at a time. Discovery over planning.

- **Explicit Policies**: Use templates for agendas and artefacts to prevent deviation from your processes. Aim for self-reinforcing practices and principles.

- **Clear Goals**: The entire organisation should understand the business mission, vision, principles, and strategy.

- **Data-Driven**: The decisions, direction, and work items are backed by data.

- **Pragmatic**: Making decisions based on what is best for the project rather than just optimising for individual preferences or technical ideals.

- **Less is more**: Having less features is sometimes the best feature. Smaller teams can be more effective than larger teams.
