# L∞P's principles

L∞P proposed ten equally essential principles:

## Customer-Centric
Everyone should be in constant direct contact with customers, understand their needs, and be obsessed with delivering value to them.
  
## Value-driven
The team is asked to deliver an outcome, not an output. The effectiveness and efficiency of the team are measured by the customers' success, not by outputs (No Burn-down charts).

## Product-Led
Remove silos between marketing, sales, customer success, and the product team.

## Trust & Ownership
The product team is tasked with leading the customer to success and having total freedom to develop the optimal solution.

## Flow-Friendly
At least 50% of working time should be allocated to focus time and be on the calendar daily.

## No Estimates & no time boxes
Use a pull-based system, focus on one work item at a time, and prioritise discovery over planning.

## Explicit policies
Use templates for agendas and artefacts to prevent deviation from your processes. Aim for self-reinforcing practices and principles.

## Clear goals
The entire organisation should understand the business mission, vision, principles, and strategy.

## Data-driven
The decisions, direction, and work items are backed by data.

## Pragmatic
Making decisions based on what is best for the project rather than just optimising for individual preferences or technical ideals.

## Less is more
Having fewer features is sometimes the best feature. Smaller teams can be more effective than larger teams.
