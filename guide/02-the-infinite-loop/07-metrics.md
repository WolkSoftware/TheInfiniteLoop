# L∞P's metrics

We use **✅ Outcome metrics over ❌ output metrics**.

## Output metrics
Output metrics measure the quantity and quality of work produced during a project. These metrics focus on the output of a project, but **do not necessarily measure the impact of that output on the desired outcome**. Examples of output metrics include:

### ❌ Burn-down chart
A burndown chart or burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. A burn down chart is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.

### ❌ Burn-up chart
A burndown chart or burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. A burn down chart is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed. 

### ❌ Lead time
Lead time is the time it takes for a work item to be completed, from the time it's received until it's marked as done.

### ❌ Cycle time
Cycle time is the time it takes for a work item to move through the entire process, from start to finish.

### ❌ Cumulative flow diagrams
A chart that shows the number of work items at each stage of the process over time, which can be used to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.

## Outcome metrics
Outcome metrics measure the impact of the output on the desired outcome or goal of the project. These metrics focus on the ultimate goal of the project and **measure the success of the output in achieving that goal**. Examples of outcome metrics include: 

### ✅ Activation Rate
Activation rate is the percentage of users who have taken a specific action, such as signing up or making a purchase, after visiting a website or using an app.

Retention is a more reliable metric for customer value than activation.
Having many new users doesn't lead to long term success if they don't stick around.

### ✅ Retention Rate
Retention rate is the percentage of users who continue to use a product or service over a specific period of time. It helps to measure the loyalty of customers.

### ✅ Lifetime Value (LTV)
Lifetime Value is the total amount of revenue a customer is expected to generate for a business over the course of their relationship.

### ✅ Feature Engagement
Feature engagement is the measurement of how frequently users are using a specific feature of a product or service.

### ✅ Cohort Analysis
This metric is used to track the behavior of groups of users over time. This helps to identify patterns and trends in user behavior and can inform product decisions.

### ✅ A/B Testing
This metric is used to compare two or more versions of a product or feature to determine which one is more effective. It can be used to determine what changes to make to improve the product.

### ✅ Change Failure Rate
Change failure rate is the percentage of changes to a product or service that result in failure, such as bugs or crashes.

### ✅ Employee satisfaction surveys
Employee satisfaction surveys are surveys that measure the level of satisfaction of employees with their job and workplace.

### ✅ Employee turnover rate
Employee turnover rate is the percentage of employees who leave a company over a specific period of time. It helps to measure the effectiveness of an organization's talent management strategies.
